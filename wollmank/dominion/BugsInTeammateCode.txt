1) The first bug is in void mineFunc() . It is a void return but returns -1. I didn’t use a debugger for this but visual studio code has a list of issues and that was one of the first on the list. I simple fix would be to return NULL or just change the type to int and in cardEffect() set it up to handle the outcomes of a negative return value. This isn’t going to make the program completely unusable, but better design would help for long readability and usability for futures devs.
2) When the user starts the executable with more than 3 as the input value, there is a segfault. The will run and produce output, but eventually there will be an error that reads in the terminal Segmentation fault: 11. Not sure where or why this is happening, my guess there is an array somewhere that is being allocated with not enough space when the game is being initialized.
